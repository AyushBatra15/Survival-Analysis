# Survival-Analysis
A survival analysis of NBA injuries

The `injury_scraping.ipynb` file has the code used to webscrape the injuries from prosportstransactions.com, the `playoff_scraping.ipynb` script has code to find the last game of each team's season, and the `injury_survival.ipynb` notebook contains the actual survival analysis. The `injury_scraping.ipynb` notebook creates the `injury_df.csv` file, and the `playoff_scraping.ipynb` notebook creates the `last_games.csv` (used in analysis) and `playoff_results.csv` (unused in analysis) data.
